## Data Visualization Techniques

Visualize metrics like task completion rates or project KPIs with built-in charts. Switch between views for deeper analysis.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Bar Charts" icon="bar-chart">
    Compare categories, such as tasks by status.

    ```javascript
    // Example data load for bar chart
    const taskData = [
      { status: "Completed", count: 45 },
      { status: "In Progress", count: 12 },
      { status: "Pending", count: 8 }
    ];
    ```

    Customize colors to match your brand (`#3B82F6` for Loz Turner).
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Line Graphs" icon="trending-up">
    Track trends over time, like daily productivity.

    ```javascript
    // Sample trend data
    const productivityData = [
      { date: "2024-01-15", score: 85 },
      { date: "2024-01-16", score: 92 },
      { date: "2024-01-17", score: 78 }
    ];
    ```

    Hover for exact values and export as PNG.

## Decision-Making Tools and Workflows

Leverage decision matrices and workflow automations to evaluate options systematically.

<Expandable title="Advanced Decision Workflow" default-open="false">

1. Input options like "Delegate to team" vs. "Handle personally".
2. Assign weights to criteria: Impact (40%), Time (30%), Risk (30%).
3. Auto-score and rank; visualize in a table.

| Option              | Impact | Time | Risk | Total Score |
|---------------------|--------|------|------|-------------|
| Delegate to team    | 9      | 8    | 6    | 7.8         |
| Handle personally   | 7      | 4    | 9    | 6.7         |
| Outsource           | 8      | 7    | 5    | 7.1         |
